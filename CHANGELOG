Clear Linux Dissector Changelog
===============================

Release 0.7 (pre-release): 22 January 2020

Changes:
* Importing a Clear Linux release now populates cover status for all packages by default, making setting up a fresh database much more useful
* Extended the import_layers.py script so that it can fetch and update OE recipe data from layers.openembedded.org, so that running update.py and fetching all layer repositories is no longer needed (and updating is much faster as a result)
* dockersetup: fixed error when updating with -u if proxy config set in environment
* dockersetup: ensure letsencrypt volume change gets undone if switching to a different TLS configuration
* Fixed "Specified key was too long" database error when running migrations to initialise a new database
* Fixed nginx error in environments where large client-side cookies are in use
* Fixed CVE-2019-16865 (denial of service vulnerability in Pillow; should not have affected this application)
* Bumped minimum Django version to avoid CVE-2019-19844 (account takeover using carefully crafted email address)
* Fixed error during setup due to MySQL/MariaDB column size issue
* Fixed "terminated (-1)" at the end of Clear Linux distro data update task even if it succeeded
* Fixed long delays and high browser CPU usage when refreshing update task page
* Fixed a layer parse issue with newer YP releases / master; that would only be an issue if you're using the update script directly though (which is no longer recommended)
* Added session inactivity timeout and enabled that and absolute timeout by default
* Added a default privacy notice page (linked from the footer of every page)
* Added basic documentation on database backup and restore to README
* Updated bundled jQuery, Chart.js and Bootstrap
* Updated pinned python packages and installed Go version in the container
* RELEASENOTES renamed to CHANGELOG



Release 0.6 (pre-release): 9th August 2019
------------------------------------------

Changes:
* dockersetup: fixed an error when https is enabled
* dockersetup: fixed a number of proxy support issues
* dockersetup: added a connectivity check to ensure you know if you are behind a proxy and your proxy configuration is not correct and complete. (This can be disabled if needed by specifying the --no-connectivity option.)
* dockersetup: added an uninstall option
* oe-image-manifest: properly gather layer information for layers at the top level of their repository
* Fixed errors/warnings when importing image comparison
* Handle non-UTF8 encoded spec files in Clear Linux
* Fixed admin logout login button redirection
* Fixed a couple of Edit Profile form message bugs:
  - Tweak message when one or more (but not all) security question answers have been changed so that it's clear that all are required
  - Ensure success message gets shown upon saving
* Tweaked password reset security question handling:
  - Require all three answers to be correct (previously only two had to be)
  - Allow three attempts instead of just two



Release 0.5 (pre-release): 16th July 2019
-----------------------------------------

Changes:
* Fixed Axes lockout not working and tone down aggressiveness slightly
* Fixed handling of different docker-compose project names (defaulted from directory name)
* Replaced custom pagination with django-bootstrap-pagination
* Fixed registration emails to include port in URLs if not the default
* Added missing permissions checks to image comparison views
* Fixed re-registration page (on email change) redirecting to login causing breakage
* dockersetup: support encryption/authentication for SMTP
* dockersetup: do not set site name if a database file is specified
* dockersetup: add an option to disable adding an admin user
* README: document how to import Clear data


Release 0.4 (pre-release): 5th June 2019
----------------------------------------

Changes:
* Move Clear Linux Dissector code to its own Django application in order to reduce the delta with the OE Layer index codebase
* Use "git diff --no-index" instead of diff to produce file diffs for release comparisons (improving file diff performance)
* Add a workaround to prevent useless ConnectionResetError admin emails when running update tasks
* Always use main download.clearlinux.org for fetching Clear release info to avoid observed incomplete file issues with cdn
* Fix characters being skipped during progressive task output when it contains entity-escaped characters
* Fix internal server errors when using . or , in image comparison name
* Ensure release comparison visibly fails if call fails immediately
* Ensure file diff failure status gets properly saved and reported
* Require different from/to branches for release comparison


Release 0.3 (beta): 13 May 2019
-------------------------------

Changes:
* Fix "internal server error" when checking Comparison checkbox on Distro Data search form
* Fix volume / file permissions within Docker containers
* Update pinned Python dependencies


Release 0.2: 8th May 2019
-------------------------

Changes:
* Handle Release Comparison of two previously imported Image comparisons - this effectively enables comparing two images built with Yocto Project tools.
* Ensure Release Comparison only allows selecting image comparison branches owned by the logged-in user
* Allow searching ClassicRecipe objects by cover_pn in admin interface


Release 0.1: 3rd May 2019
-------------------------

Changes:
* Require Python 3.4.3 to run dockersetup.py
* Added dissector command-line tool to docker app container; this is compiled when building the container.
* Re-generate SSL configuration when running "./dockersetup.py -u" in case base configuration has been updated
* Display version number in footer
